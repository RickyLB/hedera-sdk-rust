# Hedera™ SDK

> The SDK for interacting with Hedera Hashgraph: the official distributed
> consensus platform built using the hashgraph consensus algorithm for fast,
> fair and secure transactions. Hedera enables and empowers developers to
> build an entirely new class of decentralized applications.

Hedera offers support for **C**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **Rust**, **Go**, 
**Java**, **Android**, **iOS**, **React Native**, **JavaScript**, and 
**Swift**.

All libraries utilize a common core developed in **Rust** to ensure consistency 
and stability of the implementation. This does mean that to _build_ a library
you will need a working Rust compiler. Normal usage of a library does _not_
require Rust (except for the Rust library of course).
